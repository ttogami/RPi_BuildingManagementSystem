# RPi_BuildingManagementSystem

Hello! This project is a building management system which is able to theoretically turn off a buildings AC system when a door or window is opened to save energy 
and turn off lights when there is no motion detected (when no one is using the room). It is also able to detect temperature/humidity and you can set
at what point the system is supposed to switch to heating or cooling.

The Python file is my code I created and the PDF is my more in depth description of how the project works. 

Devices Used are: 
- DHT sensor
- LED pin lights
- PIR sensor
- resistors
- breadboard
- buttons
- GPIO board
- RaspberryPi
